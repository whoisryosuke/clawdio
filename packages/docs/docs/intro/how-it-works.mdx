# How It Work(lets)

## High level architecture

Ultimately we need to ship Web Audio worklets written in JavaScript and WASM bundles to NPM. We have a folder dedicated to our Rust project. Then the frontend JavaScript code will be a separate folder, that relies on WASM generated by the Rust project.

Here’s the top level structure of the code:

![The early directory structure of the project with top level folders called dist, modules, and src - each containing the library production bundle, Rust source code, and the library source code respectively.](img/high-level-architecture-monorepo.png)

When we want to write **Rust** code, we’ll do it inside `/modules/` folder. We’ll also create a separate folder for each WASM module so we can separate each module into it’s own WASM bundle, instead of having one big one to load all the effects.

The **JavaScript** code that gets released to NPM will be kept inside a `/packages/clawdio/src/` directory. We’ll have a folder dedicated to our “worklets” or `/workers/` and another folder called `/nodes/` to contain a convenient custom Audio Node that initializes the worklet properly for the user.

When we finally build our JS library, it’ll get placed inside a `/dist` folder that will be released to NPM.
