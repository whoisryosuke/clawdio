# Using Modules Directly

If you want greater control over the WASM, you can import each WASM module for each audio effect directly. They're each individually released to NPM alongside the main library.

For example the Bitcrusher node would be:

```shell
npm install clawdio-bitcrusher
```

You can find an example of how to use the WASM and initialize it properly [in the library code](https://github.com/whoisryosuke/clawdio/tree/main/packages/clawdio/src/nodes/BitcrusherNode.ts).

:::tip

Using WASM inside of Audio Worklets is a bit complex, that's why we created this library. If you want to learn more about setting this up from scratch, check out [this blog that covers using WASM in Audio Worklets](https://whoisryosuke.com/blog/2025/processing-web-audio-with-rust-and-wasm).
