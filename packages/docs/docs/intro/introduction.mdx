# What is clawdio?

clawdio is an open source JavaScript library for adding audio effects and filters to your app using WASM and Rust. We provide easy to use audio nodes, like a [Bitcrusher](effects/bitcrusher.mdx) - that adds a “crunchy” or “pixelated” effect to your signal.

Just make some audio (probably a `.mp3` sample you load as an [AudioBufferSourceNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBufferSourceNode)) and `.connect()` one of our effects to hear the difference. Check out the [getting started guide](intro/getting-started.mdx) to try it out.

You can read [a full breakdown on my blog here](https://whoisryosuke.com/blog/2025/web-audio-effect-library-with-rust-and-wasm) on how the library was created from the ground up. Or check out the ["how it works"](intro/how-it-works.mdx) section for an overview.
